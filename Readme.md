## devtools

##### These are my personal tests with developing a brew tap to experiment with different code sources as brew installable projects.

##### Eventually this will contain formulae to install my personal config/dev utilities but for now its a sandbox

### Commands:

#### First Tap:
```
brew tap tatehanawalt/devtools
```

#### Second Install:

##### Demonodejs
nodejs based brew demo
```
brew install demonodejs
```

##### Demozsh
ZSH based brew demo
```
brew install demozsh
```

##### Demo2
GO based brew demo
```
brew install demo2
```
