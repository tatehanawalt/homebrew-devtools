## <div align="center">CLI's, Utilities, and Demos distributed through [BREW](https://brew.sh/)</div><br>

<br>

:x: Note:<br>
Everything is currently in development. Nothing is actually stable right now. Even if it appears stable from README content below... 
<br>

## <div align="center">Installing</div><br>



1. Tap the repo:
```shell
brew tap tatehanawalt/devtools
```


2. Install any tools using either the **STABLE** or **HEAD** methods outlined below.

### STABLE:

Install stable distribution with the standard brew install command:
```shell
brew install <package_name>
```
### HEAD:

**Head** deploys the latest code directly from the projects source. You will get the latest elements of the tools but the tools may not always work to the standards offered from the stable installatioin method

Install tools using the **head** method by adding the `--HEAD` flag in the install command just before the `<package_name>`. For example:

```shell
brew install --HEAD <package_name>
```
